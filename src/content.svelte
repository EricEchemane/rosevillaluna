    <h1> About me </h1>
    <p> 
        Good Day everyone! My name is Rose Anne H. Villaluna taking Bachelor of Science in Secondary education major in Social Studies. I have a twin sister her name is Remy Anne H. Villaluna taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. We are currently living here in Sta Cruz Occidental Mindoro together with our parents. I was good in school and I received a lot of certificates from different subjects. My favorite colors are purple and yellow. I love helping and involving in school activities. Having a great experience here in our province together with our family and relatives is such a wonderful feeling ❤️. My tatay is a farmer and my mama is a house wife who taught us to be a good person. I do love my friends in CITCS department because there are the one who cheer me up to do what I really want in life.

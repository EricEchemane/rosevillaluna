Having a great experience here in our province together with our family and relatives is such a wonderful feeling ❤️. My tatay is a farmer and my mama is a house wife who taught us to be a good person.

    <h1> About my course </h1>
    <p> 
        To be honest I got some knowledge about technology because I was a Computer
Science student way back 2019. I was 1st year college that time and using different
types of software was an easy task for me just kidding HAHA. It was difficult at first and
that is the reason why am shifted to education. It is too late that I realized technology
are part of our life. Students can learn useful life skills through technology Modern
learning is about collaborating with others, solving complex problems, critical thinking,
developing different forms of communication and leadership skills, and improving
motivation and productivity. Giving a chance to study technology for teaching learning
was an honor for me because I know someday I will be able to use it for my professional
career.

    <h1> Reflection on my course </h1>
    <p>I was a shiftee from Computer Science Department. I decided to shift in Education because of my passion and dedication to my course. I&#39;m a Social Studies educator because I want my students to become a good citizen and a good decision makers of this country. I want them to engage and explore how the world changed by our actions and decisions. I do love giving people an opportunity to develop and grow in our surroundings by giving an education. Education will be the best choice for the youth and children.

    <h1> Professor </h1>
    <p>
        Teaching this course is a challenging task for a professor because some of my classmates doesn’t know how to explore some reliable sources and software that can help them to build an amazing and knowledgeable website. For me, you are an amazing person and a gift from above. You never failed us to develop our own perspective and skills. Thank you for your sacrifice and dedication.
